# d3 Visualisations of Taxi Journeys

A repository containing the best of my experiments with d3. The visualisation
shows a sample of taxi journeys being made through Porto, Portugal.

This repository is very, very old but I still like the visualisation :)

Thanks to http://zevross.com/blog/2014/09/30/use-the-amazing-d3-library-to-animate-a-path-on-a-leaflet-map/ for getting this code started.
